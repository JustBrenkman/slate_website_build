:s: Introduction
# Introduction
This tutorial will walk you through the steps of changing the value properties of a Component. As an example, you will be changing a Text Widget. By the end of the tutorial you will be able to change the value properties for any Component.

:s: What is a Value
# What is a Value
A value is a property that you can type into to change.

There are three types of values:
:n:
## text
![text](assets/pictures/tutorials/change_values/text.jpg#588x60)
;;
## true/false
![text](assets/pictures/tutorials/change_values/true_false.jpg#588x60)
;;
## number - which is either a "whole number" or a "decimal"

:s: Changing a Value
# Changing a Value
Click on the Text Widget in the center of the Shell.

:n:
## text:
The first property is already filled in with text. You can click in the first property and modify it to anything you like. When you are done, hit enter and it will change the text. This has changed the value for a text property.

:n:
## numbers:
The property second from the bottom is labelled "Text Scale Factor". You can click in and type a decimal. When you are done, hit enter and it will scale the size of the text (this is not the font-size). This has changed the value for a "decimal" property. If it was "whole number", it coudn't have a decimal and should be greater than 0.

:n:
## true/false:
There is a property towards the middle labelled "Soft Wrap". You can click in and type "true" or "false" (no quotes) and hit enter and it will change how the text is wrapped (won't see any affect in this example). This has changed the value for a "true/false" property.

:s: Undoing Changes
# Undoing Changes
You changed the size, but what if you liked it better before? You can keep entering numbers to try and get a different size, but to get back to it's original state we can undo our last change.
:n:

To undo, go to the Menu Bar, Edit, Undo.

You can use undo to go back after any change you make. Similarly, you can redo as well.

# Introduction
Welcolme! This tutorial is intended to help you understand how Slate works. It will get you up and running with your first app. At the end of the tutorial, you will be able to see your app appear on the screen.

Go to where you unzipped the Slate folder and start it by double clicking Slate.exe. If you haven't done the setup tutorial, you will need to do that first.

Slate should take a second to start. Once open it should look like this:

Slate is built on Flutter, which is code for making apps. Flutter is made up of Widgets which are visual elements for your app. Slate handles the code creation and management for you, but gives you the freedom and ability to add or remove Widgets to create any layout you want.

:s: Creating a Project
# Creating a Project
To create your first app, select "Add" and name your project.

Slate will create a new project and automatically open it for you when it has finished.

In the future, if you want to continue working on an existing project it will appear in a list on the left and you can open it simply by clicking on it.

:s: Starting the Shell
# Starting the Shell
In Slate, there are different pieces you can add to your app, all of which are called Components. Some Components are Widgets, but not all. For example, if you wanted to add some text saying "Hello World!", you would add a Text Widget.

The Shell allows you to visualize and interact with your app in real time. It is your app, fully built and how it would look on an iOS or Android phone. You can start the Shell by clicking the green start button on the right of the Slate toolbar. The Shell needs to prepare your app before it can appear, so it may take a little while.

You will see a progress bar at the bottom of Slate which tells you how far along it is. The entire bottom section is the Event Bar, which will give you information and status updates about what Slate is doing. As soon as the Shell finishes it will pop up. This is your app!

:s: Interacting with the Shell
# Interacting with the Shell
Once the shell is loaded you can interact with your app. When you click on a UI Widget in the Shell, the properties of that Widget will appear in the Properties View.

As you make changes in the Properties View, you will see those changes in the Shell.

:s: Properties View
# Properties View
The Properties View is where you will actually edit your app. Each Widget has properties associated with it. Some examples include color, size, width, height, and more. By editing these properties, you can create complex and beautiful apps.

There are three different types of properties: Components, Options, and Values.

To change a property you can: drag and drop a Component, select an Option from a drop down list, or type in a Value.
